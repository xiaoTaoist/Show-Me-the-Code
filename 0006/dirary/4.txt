Serena Williams said she felt like a "superhero" in the black catsuit she wore during the 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 win over Kristyna Pliskova at the French Open.

The temperature hit 25C in Paris but it did not seem to affect the 23-time major winner in her first Grand Slam match since giving birth last September.

"I feel like a warrior wearing it, a queen from Wakanda [referring to the Black Panther movie] maybe," she said.

"It was comfortable to wear."

The 36-year-old added: "I'm always living in a fantasy world. I always wanted to be a superhero, and it's kind of my way of being a superhero."

Williams also said the outfit helped her cope with the issue of blood clots, which she revealed, in February, almost cost her life.

"I had a lot of problems with those - I don't know how many I have had in the past 12 months," she said. "It definitely has little functionality to it.

"It's a fun suit, but it's also functional so I'm able to play without any problems."
